        charges prepaid, and shall be addressed to each member entitled
        to vote, at the address or email address of that member as it
        appears on the books of the Corporation or at the address given
        by the member to the Corporation for purposes of notice.
        Provided, however, that any member may revoke authorization to
        receive notices from the Corporation by email. Such revocation

            notice of any meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting,
            entitled to vote by written ballot, or entitled to exercise
            any rights in any lawful action, the Board of Directors may,
            in advance, fix a record date. The record date for the
            following actions will be fixed as follows:

                less than 10 days before the date of the meeting;

                the date of the meeting;

            3.  Voting by written ballot shall be no more than 70 days
                before the day on which the first written ballot is
                mailed or solicited; and

            4.  Taking any other action shall be no more than 70 days
                before that action.

        2.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for
            determining members entitled to receive notice of a members'
            business meeting shall be the next business day preceding
            the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived,
            the next business day preceding the day on which the meeting
            is held. If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record
            date for determining members entitled to vote at the meeting
            shall be the day on which the meeting is held.

        3.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for
            determining members entitled to vote by written ballot shall
            be the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or
            solicited.

        4.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for
            determining members entitled to exercise any rights with
            respect to any other lawful action shall be the date on
            which the Board adopts the resolution relating to that
            action, or the 70th day before the date of that action,
            whichever is later.

        5.  For purposes of Section 3.19 of this Article, a person
            holding a membership at the close of business on the record
            date shall be a member of record.

        6.  A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote
            at a meeting of the members shall be effective for any
            adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors
            fixes a new record date, which it shall do if the meeting is
            adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed
            for the original meeting.

        7.  If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than
            120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it
            may provide that the original record date continues in
            effect or it may fix a new record date.

    <!-- -->

    13. MEMBERS LIST FOR MEETINGS
        -------------------------

        1.  After fixing a record date for a meeting, the Corporation
            shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its
            members that are entitled to notice of that meeting of the
            members. The list shall show the address of and number of
            votes each member is entitled to cast at the meeting.

        2.  The list of members shall be available for inspection by any
            member, beginning two business days after notice of the
            meeting is given for which the list was prepared and
            continuing through the meeting, at the Corporation's
            principal office or at a place identified in the meeting
            notice in the city where the meeting will be held.

        3.  Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the list of
            members shall not affect the validity of action taken at the
            meeting.

    14. QUORUM
        ------

> The Member Representatives present at any duly held members\' business
> meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at
> said members\' business meeting. Attendance for the purpose of
> establishing a quorum shall be made in person or via teleconference by
> a Member Representative, provided that any meeting held by
> teleconference must allow Member Representatives the opportunity to
> read or hear the proceedings substantially concurrently with their
> occurrence, vote on matters submitted to the members, pose questions,
> and make comments.

15. VOTING
    ------

    1.  Subject to the Act, all members in good standing on the record
        date shall be entitled to vote at any members\' business
        meeting.

    2.  The Member Representative of each member entitled to vote may
        cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of members.

    3.  Voting may be by voice or by ballot, except that any election of
        directors must be by ballot if demanded before the voting begins
        by any member eligible to vote at the meeting. The Board may
        provide for members to vote by ballot via electronic mail (i.e.,
        email) or electronic message board or network, but only as
        follows:

        1.  Member Representatives may vote via email when their email
            is directed to the email address that the Corporation has
            provided from time to time to members for sending such
            communications to the Corporation.

        2.  Member Representatives may vote via electronic message board
            or network that the Corporation has designated for those
            communications, and which transmission shall be validly
            delivered upon the posting.

        3.  Voting via email, electronic message board and network shall
            only be permitted and valid if the Corporation has placed in
            effect reasonable measures to verify that the sender is the
            member purporting to send the transmission and that creates
            a record that is capable of retention, retrieval, and
            review, and that may thereafter be rendered into clearly
            legible tangible form.

        4.  The Corporation may not send a ballot by email if the
            authority to communicate with the member has been revoked as
            set forth in Section 3.11.3.

            3.15.4. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a
            majority of the voting power represented at the meeting,
            entitled to vote, and voting on the matter, shall be deemed
            the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number
            is required by the Act, these bylaws, or the Articles of
            Incorporation.

<!-- -->

16. WAIVER OF NOTICE
    ----------------

    1.  The transaction of any members' business meeting, however called
        or noticed and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken
        at a meeting duly held after standard call and notice if:

        1.  A quorum is present, and

        2.  Either before or after the meeting, each member entitled to
            vote, not present in person, signs a written waiver of
            notice, a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an
            approval of the minutes of the meeting. The waiver of
            notice, consent or approval need not specify either the
            business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting
            except that, if action is taken or proposed to be taken for
            approval of any matter specified in Section 3.11.2 of this
            Article, the waiver of notice, consent or approval shall
            state the general nature of the proposal. All such waivers,
            consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate
            records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

    2.  A member's attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
        notice of that meeting unless the member objects at the
        beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
        because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.
        Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object
        to the consideration of matters required to be included in the
        notice of the meeting but not so included, if the objection is
        expressly made at the meeting.

ACTIONS BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT
------------------------------------

> Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be
> taken without a meeting if all members consent in writing to the
> action. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the
> minutes of the meeting. The action by written consent shall have the
> same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the members.

18. ACTION BY WRITTEN BALLOT
    ------------------------

    1.  Any action that may be taken at any annual, regular, or special
        meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the
        membership corporation delivers a ballot to every member
        entitled to vote on the matter.

    2.  A ballot shall:

        3.  Set forth each proposed action;

        4.  Be in the form of a record;

        5.  Set forth each proposed action;

        6.  Provide an opportunity to vote for, or withhold a vote for,
            each candidate for election as a director; and

        7.  Provide an opportunity to vote for or against each other
            proposed action.

    3.  Approval by ballot pursuant to this section of action other than
        election of directors shall be valid only when the number of
        votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be
        present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of
        approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be
        required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total
        number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by
